You need to create a account on the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and obtain the access token. After that, you need do put this key in the .env file at the root of the project.

If you prefer, you can just uncomment this line below in the OrphanagesMap.tsx file to use another map option.
```JSX
{* <TileLayer url ="https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" /> *}
```

You can also change latitude and longitude to match your location. To do this, just visit the [Google Maps](maps.google.com) and copy the latitude and longitude of the URL, as in the example below:

https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.64201,-46.6029906,15z

In this case, the latitude is -23.64201 and the longitude is -46.6029906.

Then, replace the latititude and longitude on the center property of the Map component in the OrphanagesMap.tsx file.
